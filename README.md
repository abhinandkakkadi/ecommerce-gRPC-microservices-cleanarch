## Project Overview

An e-commerce app broken down into 4 services (admins, carts, products, users) and an API gateway for direct client communication, all running on their individual ports. It's a broken down version of my e-commerce project built using clean architecture design pattern.

## Run Locally

enter into the root directory and run

```bash
  make up_build  #stops all services (if running), builds all services and starts docker compose
```

```bash
  make down  #stop all services
```

```bash
  docker-compose up -d  #starts all services in the background without forcing build
```
